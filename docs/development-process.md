# Development Process

## Planning Phase
1. Identified the game requirements and features
2. Designed the game flow and user interface
3. Planned the code structure and functions

## Implementation Steps
1. Created the basic game structure with a function to handle the game logic
2. Implemented random number generation using Python's `random` module
3. Added user input handling with validation
4. Implemented the game loop with attempt counting
5. Added feedback for high/low guesses
6. Implemented the option to play multiple rounds
7. Added clear instructions and user-friendly messages

## Testing
1. Tested the game with various inputs (valid numbers, invalid inputs, edge cases)
2. Verified that the random number generation works correctly
3. Tested the attempt counting and game-over conditions
4. Verified that the play-again functionality works as expected

## Version Control
The project was developed using Git for version control with the following workflow:
1. Initial commit with basic project structure
2. Added game logic implementation
3. Added input validation
4. Enhanced user interface and messages
5. Added documentation and README
6. Final testing and bug fixes
